FILES
======
 .aps    - AVR Studio projects
 .aws    - AVR Studio thing (generated as necessary)
 .[ch]   - sources


DEVELOPMENT
===========
Every projects empties the "\BUILD"-directory and writes a new hex file there, then uploaded via OHC to KBs.

Easiest way to start a new project:
  1. copy KBShouter.aps to KBMyProgram.aps (other existing project are fine, may have more stuff)
  2. do a keyword replace (e.g. Notepad) on KBMyProgram.aps: "KBShouter" -> "KBMyProgram"
  3. copy KBShouter.c to KBMyProgram.c
  4. open KBMyProgram.aps with AVR Studio
  5. ???
  6. Profit


CALIBRATION
===========

Aiming for 90deg/4.5s angular velocity.


NOTE
====

Size is an issue: 
 - hard  SRAM bound    2KB
 - hard FLASH bound   32KB

ram = data+bss
flash = text+data

  Run... >> cmd

 $>  cd C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop\kbcode\build
 $>  C:\WinAVR-20100110\bin\avr-size.exe *.elf *.hex

e.g.
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  12294     464     232   12990    32be KBAbot.elf

Aim for: dec - bss < 12800
